        <h2>Dalkey</h2>
        <p>Dalkey is an affluent suburb of Dublin, and a seaside resort southeast of the city, and the town of Dún Laoghaire, in the historic County Dublin, Ireland. It was founded as a Viking settlement and became an active port during the Middle Ages. According to chronicler John Clyn (c.1286–c.1349), it was one of the ports through which the plague entered Ireland in the mid-14th century. In modern times, Dalkey has become a seaside suburb that attracts some tourist visitors.</p>
        <p>One of Dublin's wealthiest districts, it has been home to writers and celebrities including Jane Emily Herbert, Maeve Binchy, Robert Fisk, Hugh Leonard, Bono, the Edge, Van Morrison and Enya. Dalkey lies within the jurisdiction of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council.</p>
